<h3 title="1st class">1. Object State and Behavior</h3> 
<p> <b>State:</b> The state of an object is represented by its attributes or properties, also known as fields or instance variables. For <b>example, in a Car class, attributes like color, model, and speed define the state of a Car object.</b></p>
<p><b>Behavior:</b> Behavior represents what an object can do and is defined by its methods. In the Car example, <b>methods like accelerate(), brake(), or turn() represent the behavior of a Car.</b></p>
<p>An object's state can change over time as its behavior (methods) interacts with it, modifying its fields.</p> <hr>
