<h3 title="programing">1. Object State and Behavior</h3> <hr>
<p>State: The state of an object is represented by its attributes or properties, also known as fields or instance variables. For example, in a Car class, attributes like color, model, and speed define the state of a Car object.</p>
<p>Behavior: Behavior represents what an object can do and is defined by its methods. In the Car example, methods like accelerate(), brake(), or turn() represent the behavior of a Car.</p>
<p>An object's state can change over time as its behavior (methods) interacts with it, modifying its fields.</p>
