<h1 title="class notes">Object State and Behavior</h1>

<p>In object-oriented programming, an <strong>object</strong> represents a real-world physical entity. Anything or everything that physically exists can be considered an object.</p>

<h2>Object Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State</strong>: The state of an object refers to its properties or information that describes it.</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior</strong>: The behavior of an object is the action or work that the object can perform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example: Myntra Application</h2>
<p>Consider a product (e.g., a shoe) in the Myntra application. This product (shoe) is an object with specific states and behaviors.</p>

<h3>State</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Price</li>
  <li>Size</li>
  <li>Discount</li>
  <li>Color</li>
  <li>Customer Rating</li>
  <li>...and more</li>
</ul>

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>addToBag()</code> - Adds the item to the shopping bag.</li>
  <li><code>addToWishList()</code> - Adds the item to the wishlist.</li>
  <li><code>buy()</code> - Initiates the purchase of the item.</li>
  <li><code>cancel()</code> - Cancels the item order.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Class and Object</h2>

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>
    A class is a logical entity or blueprint used to create objects. It is also considered the descriptor for an object.
</p>

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
    An object cannot be created without a class. Thus, the first step is to create the class, and then only can we create an object.
</p>
<p>
    An object is a real-world physical entity, which is an instance of a class. We can create multiple objects using a single class, which are technically called similar or identical objects. If one object is destroyed or deleted, it will neither affect another object nor the class.
</p>
<p>
    Every object works independently.

<p>
    The grammar of a programming language is its syntax.
